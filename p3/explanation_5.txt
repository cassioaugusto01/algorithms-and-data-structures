We have a TrieNode class that contains children and a flag indicating whether
the node is the end of a word. The insert method adds a child node for a given
character if it doesn't already exist. The suffixes method is a recursive function 
that collects all suffixes of complete words below the current node.

The Trie class has a root node and methods for inserting words and finding nodes
for prefixes. The insert method adds a word to the trie by traversing and adding
nodes as needed, and marking the last node as the end of a word. The find method
returns the node representing a given prefix, or None if the prefix is not found
in the trie.

The provided test code creates a trie, inserts a list of words, and tests the 
autocomplete functionality using the suffixes method.

Here is the modular complexity analysis for each method in the Trie and TrieNode classes:

TrieNode.insert:
Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)

TrieNode.suffixes:
Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N)
(Where N is the total number of nodes in the trie)

Trie.init:
Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Trie.insert:
Time Complexity: O(L)
Space Complexity: O(L)
(Where L is the length of the word being inserted)

Trie.find:
Time Complexity: O(P)
Space Complexity: O(1)
(Where P is the length of the prefix being searched)
