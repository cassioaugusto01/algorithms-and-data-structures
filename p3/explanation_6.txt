The get_min_max function finds the minimum and maximum values from a list of 
unsorted integers in linear time. We initialize min_val and max_val with the 
first element of the input list.

We then iterate through the input list. If we find a number smaller than 
min_val, we update min_val with that number. If we find a number larger 
than max_val, we update max_val with that number.

At the end of the iteration, we return a tuple (min_val, max_val) 
containing the minimum and maximum values.

Efficiency:

The time complexity of the solution is O(n) as we traverse the input 
list once. The space complexity is O(1) as we use constant extra space 
to store the minimum and maximum values.
