he sort_012 function sorts an array consisting of only 0, 1, and 2 in a single
traversal. We use the Dutch National Flag Problem algorithm to achieve this.

We initialize three pointers - low, mid, and high. The low pointer tracks the
position of the next 0, the mid pointer tracks the position of the next 1, and
the high pointer tracks the position of the next 2.

We iterate through the input list with the mid pointer. When we find a 0, we
swap it with the element at the low pointer and increment both the low and mid
pointers. When we find a 1, we just increment the mid pointer. When we find a 2,
we swap it with the element at the high pointer and decrement the high pointer.

The function returns the sorted input list.

Efficiency:
The solution has a time complexity of O(n) as we traverse the input list once.
The space complexity is O(1) as we don't use any additional data structures.
