The rearrange_digits function rearranges array elements to form two numbers
with the maximum sum. We use the merge sort algorithm to sort the input list in
descending order.

merge_sort function is a standard implementation of the merge sort algorithm.
merge function combines two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

Once the input list is sorted in descending order, we create two strings num1
and num2. We iterate through the sorted list and add alternating elements to
num1 and num2. This approach ensures that we create two numbers with the
maximum possible sum.

We return num1 and num2 as integers.

Efficiency:
The solution has a time complexity of O(nlog(n)) due to the merge sort algorithm.
The space complexity is O(n) because the merge sort creates additional arrays
during the sorting process.
